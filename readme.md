# 🏍️ BikeBecho.com - Static Web Marketplace Concept

A proof-of-concept for a bike buying and selling platform, built using core front-end technologies to demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including form validation and external CSS management.

## 🌟 Features Implemented

* **Multi-Page Structure:** A logical separation of content across three main pages:
    * `index.html`: The homepage featuring a distinct visual design.
    * `list.html`: A static listing page displaying bikes for sale.
    * `sell.html`: A form page for users to submit their bike data.
* **External CSS:** All styling is managed in a separate `styles.css` file, promoting maintainability and clean HTML structure.
* **Visual Branding:** Integration of custom logo (`logo.jpg`) and a hero background image (`background.jpg`) for visual appeal.
* **Client-Side Form Validation:** The `sell.html` form includes **JavaScript** to prevent default submission, validate required fields (especially numeric data like price and mileage), and provide immediate user feedback.
